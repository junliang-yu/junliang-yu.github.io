Hello, this is Junliang Yu. I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow with the [Data Science](https://eecs.uq.edu.au/data-science) discipline at The University of Queensland (UQ), where I work closely with [Prof. Hongzhi Yin](https://sites.google.com/view/hongzhi-yin/home) and [Prof. Shazia Sadiq](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1Jo0EmIAAAAJ&hl=en). Prior to starting my postdoc in 2023, I completed my PhD degree at UQ under the supervision of Prof. Hongzhi Yin. Before that, I earned my M.Sc. and B.E. degrees at Chongqing University, where I was supervised by [Prof. Min Gao](http://www.cse.cqu.edu.cn/info/2095/7111.htm). I am dedicated to conducting influential and reproducible research. My work has received over 3,500 citations as of November 2024, with five of my conference papers being recognized as [The Most Influential Papers](https://www.paperdigest.org/2024/05/most-influential-sigir-papers-2024-05/) by Paper Digest and three of my journal papers being recognized as [ESI Hot / Highly Cited Papers]() in my research areas. I am also actively involved in the open-source community and have developed two popular recommender system frameworks, [QRec](https://github.com/Coder-Yu/QRec) and [SELFRec](https://github.com/Coder-Yu/SELFRec), which have together garnered over 2,000 stars.
