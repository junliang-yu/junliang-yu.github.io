Hello, this is <b>Junliang Yu</b> (<b>余俊良</b> in Chinese). I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in [Data Science](https://itee.uq.edu.au/data-science) at [The University of Queensland](https://www.uq.edu.au/), where I work closely with <b>[Prof. Hongzhi Yin](https://sites.google.com/view/hongzhi-yin/home)</b> and <b>[Prof. Shazia Sadiq](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1Jo0EmIAAAAJ&hl=en)</b>. Prior to starting my postdoc in 2023, I completed my PhD degree at The University of Queensland under the supervision of Prof. Hongzhi Yin. Before that, I earned my M.Sc. and B.E. degrees at Chongqing University, where I was supervised by <b>[Prof. Min Gao](http://www.cse.cqu.edu.cn/info/2095/7111.htm)</b>. I am dedicated to conducting influential and reproducible research. My work has received over 3,000 citations as of August 2024, with six of my papers being recognized as <b>[the most influential papers](https://www.paperdigest.org/2024/05/most-influential-sigir-papers-2024-05/)</b> in my research areas. I am also actively involved in the open-source community and have developed two popular recommender system frameworks, <b>[QRec](https://github.com/Coder-Yu/QRec)</b> and <b>[SELFRec](https://github.com/Coder-Yu/SELFRec)</b>, which have together garnered over 2,000 stars.
