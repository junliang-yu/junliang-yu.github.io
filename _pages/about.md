I am currently a postdoctoral research fellow in [Data Science](https://itee.uq.edu.au/data-science) at [The University of Queensland](https://www.uq.edu.au/), working with [Prof. Hongzhi Yin](https://sites.google.com/view/hongzhi-yin/home) and [Prof. Shazia Sadiq](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1Jo0EmIAAAAJ&hl=en). Prior to starting my postdoc in 2023, I completed my PhD degree at The University of Queensland under the supervision of [Prof. Hongzhi Yin](https://sites.google.com/view/hongzhi-yin/home). Before that, I earned my M.Sc. and B.E. degrees at Chongqing University, supervised by Prof. [Prof. Min Gao](http://www.cse.cqu.edu.cn/info/2095/7111.htm). I am dedicated to conducting influential and reproducible research. To date, I have six papers recognized as either the most influential or as ESI highly cited papers.
