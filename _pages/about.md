Hello, this is Junliang Yu. I am currently an ARC DECRA Research Fellow in the [Data Science](https://eecs.uq.edu.au/data-science) discipline at The University of Queensland (UQ). Prior to this, I worked as a postdoctoral research fellow with [Prof. Shazia Sadiq](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1Jo0EmIAAAAJ&hl=en), and completed my PhD at UQ in 2023 under the supervision of [Prof. Hongzhi Yin](https://sites.google.com/view/hongzhi-yin/home). Before joining UQ, I obtained my M.Sc. and B.E. degrees from Chongqing University, where I was advised by [Prof. Min Gao](http://www.cse.cqu.edu.cn/info/2095/7111.htm).

My research focuses on developing reliable and reproducible methods in recommender systems and data science. As of March 2025, my publications have been cited over 4,000 times. Several of my works have been recognised as [The Most Influential Papers](https://www.paperdigest.org/2024/05/most-influential-sigir-papers-2024-05/) by Paper Digest, and three journal articles have been listed as [ESI Hot / Highly Cited Papers](). I have also delivered four tutorials at top-tier conferences, contributing to community knowledge-sharing and collaboration. In addition, I am committed to open-source development, and have created two recommender system toolkits, [QRec](https://github.com/Coder-Yu/QRec) and [SELFRec](https://github.com/Coder-Yu/SELFRec), which are actively used by researchers and practitioners.
