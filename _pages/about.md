I am a final-year Ph.D. student of Data Science at The University of Queensland, who is jointly supervised by [A/Prof. Hongzhi Yin](https://sites.google.com/view/hongzhi-yin/home) and [Prof. Zi (Helen) Huang](https://staff.itee.uq.edu.au/huang/). I completed my Bachelor and Master degrees at Chongqing University. My research interests lie in recommender systems, social media analytics, deep learning on graphs, and self-supervised learning, with a particular focus on self-supervised recommendation.
