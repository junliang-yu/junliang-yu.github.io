Hello, this is Junliang Yu. I am currently an ARC DECRA Research Fellow in the [Data Science](https://eecs.uq.edu.au/data-science) discipline at The University of Queensland (UQ). Prior to this, I worked as a postdoctoral research fellow with [Prof. Shazia Sadiq](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1Jo0EmIAAAAJ&hl=en), and completed my PhD at UQ in 2023 under the supervision of [Prof. Hongzhi Yin](https://sites.google.com/view/hongzhi-yin/home). Before joining UQ, I obtained my M.Sc. and B.E. degrees from Chongqing University, where I was advised by [Prof. Min Gao](http://www.cse.cqu.edu.cn/info/2095/7111.htm).

My research interests include recommender systems, graph learning, social network analysis, generative AI and multi-agent systems. As of September 2025, my publications have been cited over 5,000 times. Several of my works have been recognised as [The Most Influential Papers](https://www.paperdigest.org/2024/05/most-influential-sigir-papers-2024-05/) by Paper Digest, and three journal articles have been listed as [ESI Hot / Highly Cited Papers](). I have also delivered four tutorials about recommender systems and graph machine learning at top-tier conferences, contributing to community knowledge-sharing and collaboration. In addition, I am committed to open-source development, and have created two recommender system toolkits, [QRec](https://github.com/Coder-Yu/QRec) and [SELFRec](https://github.com/Coder-Yu/SELFRec), which are actively used by researchers and practitioners.
